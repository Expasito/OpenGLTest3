# OpenGLTest3

OpenGLTest3 is a Renderer designed for a game engine. While not finished, it posesses many features of a simple game engine. <br>

OpenGLTest3 has a very intuitive interface for moving objects, modifying them, moving around, creating or removing entities, adding textures. Currently does not support mouse picking for objects. Was in the works but the newer version has more focus at the moment

RenderProject is the next version of this but without the 'engine' features because that is only a render.

<br>
Here is an image of what the window looks like. It supports an editor for the models and a camera for viewing the scene. As stated before, RenderProject will take over as the render for this repo. After finishing that or at least getting it to a stable point, I may return to working on a game engine. For the future, I would divide each main component into seperate projects and then integrate them together rather than make them all at the same time.
