# OpenGLTest3

OpenGLTest3 is a Renderer designed for a game engine. While not finished, it posesses many features of a simple game engine. <br>

OpenGLTest3 has a very intuitive interface for moving objects, modifying them, moving around, creating or removing entities, adding textures. Currently does not support mouse picking for objects. Was in the works but the newer version has more focus at the moment

RenderProject is the next version of this but without the 'engine' features because that is only a render.
