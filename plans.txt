Short term:
1. default component adding system using parameter packs and typename
2. each rectangle gets a texture(could be different) for a cube entity

Long term plans for OpenGLTest3

1. Fully working camera   COMPLETE
2. Instancing
3. Spheres, cubes, triangles/pyramids
4. multithreading
5. lighting
6. shadows
7. raytracing
8.


If we really want to suffer, allow for multiple textcords in seperate vbo and passed in as uniform array. Use gl_VertexID and other things to calculate
